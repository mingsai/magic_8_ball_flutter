# magic_8_ball_flutter

A Flutter demo that I've extended to run on mac/linux desktops in addition to iOS/Android.

## Before Getting Started

To quickly rename a project and package
flutter create --org com.yourcompany --project-name new_app_name .

This won't change the home directory folder 

## MAKE A BACKUP
Beware of the option to overwrite as it will give you a default demo and remove your files 
--overwrite (see alternative to overwrite below)

## Alternative to OVERWRITE
trash the android and ios folders before running the flutter create command above since these folders can be recreated.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repo and try to remake the sample on your own.
- Find new errors and correct them.
